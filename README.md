# GitBase-ts

This project is a TypeScript reconstruction of [GitBase](https://github.com/qiayue/GitBase). You can find this project at [https://github.com/timsims/GitBase-ts](https://github.com/timsims/GitBase-ts).

GitBase-ts is an enhanced, type-safe version of the original GitBase - an open-source dynamic website solution without a traditional database, built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn/UI. It leverages GitHub as a content management system, providing a seamless way to create and manage website content.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
